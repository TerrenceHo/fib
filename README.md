# Fibonacci Benchmarking

Here we go through several ways to implement the fibonacci sequence, including:
* Recursive
* Recursive with caching
* Tail Recursive
* Iterative
* Matrix Multiplcation
* \\(Log_n\\) Matrix Implementation.

Benchmarks and tests are included. My benchmark results are included in
`benchmark.txt`.

I wrote this corresponding [blog
post](https://terrenceho.org/post/benchmarking-fibonacci/) to describe the methodology.
